Very Personalised Much Real Time Super Dynamic Ad
--- Pretend you own a chocolate brand and you want to advertise on our website, but has no resourec to create ads? 
--- Pretend you're a customer browsing around the website and getting an AD that is very relevant you ended up putting that item to the basket
--- Pretend you're a media agency and you have a new "product" to sell to agencies / brands 


Why do we want this? 
For Customers: A new ad placement that will be extermely personalised AND additive to the customers' experience 

For Media Agency: A new media and service to sell, revenue making

For Suppliers/Agencies/Brands: A new way to dynamically create ads without the need of creating creatives.

Gamification to ads ---> make ads more interactive
- Instead of an image / video, ads could be simple mini games:
-- Throw item (exact sku image) to a basket / trolley
--- Users can have 2 consecutive actions: direction then power
  --- if they manage to get the item to the basket / trolley
  ----- the item actually gets added to the basket + a special discount / points added 

Supplier config,
- A page (a new channel within Pollen techincally) on settings for these ads
